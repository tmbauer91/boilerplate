A RESTful Web Service to store and retrieve files

## Motivation
This is meant to be a simple rest battery to take mission files from various video games submitted for upload by a front end and store them in a Mongo database for later retrieval. This will facilitate both hosting the files in an easily accessible spot for users to retrieve them, as well as allow front end functionality to retrieve and edit the files to insert pertinent briefing material before distribution. 

## Tech/framework used

Built with
* Spring Rest
* Swagger
* MongoDb
* Gradle

## Installation

Download the zip to your workspace, then import it into your IDE of choice. Either run it directly from there, or combile it into a jar
